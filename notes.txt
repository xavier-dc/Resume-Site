Wrap all content at about 70% for desktop
and 90% for mobile

Changing things dependin gon screen size = css media queries

-Seems like the "scrollto" function is going too far into the page, cutting off the actual headers.

-instead of contact section need another replacement section. Maybe game development, WIP, or a seperate section for Maybe

-Do Not display mobile apps I've made, since they have nothing to do with web development

Include logos for Technologies sections to make it look nice
