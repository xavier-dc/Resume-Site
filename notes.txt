Wrap all content at about 70% for desktop
and 90% for mobile

.container { width: 70% }

Changing things dependin gon screen size = css media queries

For About Me section.. make it 70% to keep it from being one long line of text.

play around with container size anywhere from 80 -50% but recommend 70% width across the whole site.

gives some padding to the side and brings content into the center.
