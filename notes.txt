Wrap all content at about 70% for desktop
and 90% for mobile

Changing things dependin gon screen size = css media queries

-Seems like the "scrollto" function is going too far into the page, cutting off the actual headers.

-instead of contact section need another replacement section. Maybe WIP, or a seperate section for Maybe
broadcast experience? (as long as it's relevant).

-Do Not display mobile apps I've made, since they have nothing to do with web development

----------------------------------
Include logos for Technologies sections to make it look nice

Consider media queries for being able to change CSS properties/transitions

--When you hover over the projects, it auto-plays and shows a short clip of what the website
does.

TECHNOLOGIES:
-Include Git/Github
